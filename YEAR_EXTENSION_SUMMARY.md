# Year Extension Summary - 2000 to 2023

## Successfully Extended to 24 Years!

### What Was Done:
1. **Added years 2003-2007** - No problematic countries
2. **Added years 2008-2023** - 2 problematic country codes identified
3. **Updated UI** - Slider now covers full 2000-2023 range
4. **Updated subtitle** - Now shows "2000 to 2023"

### Problematic Countries Found:
- **MLW (Malawi)** - Appeared in 2021 and 2022 data
  - This ISO code is not in our countries.csv file
  - Likely a new country code or data entry issue
  - These cases were excluded from the visualization

### Key Data Insights:

#### Peak Years (2000-2010)
- Widespread polio across Africa and Asia
- Major outbreaks in Nigeria, India, Pakistan
- 2010: Tajikistan outbreak (458 cases)

#### Decline Phase (2011-2019)
- India eliminated polio (last case 2011)
- Africa making progress
- Syria outbreak due to conflict (2013-2014)
- Most cases concentrated in Pakistan/Afghanistan

#### Near Eradication (2020-2023)
- 2020: 6 countries affected
- 2021: 4 countries (plus excluded Malawi)
- 2022: 4 countries (plus excluded Malawi)
- 2023: **Only 2 countries** - Pakistan (6 cases) and Afghanistan (6 cases)

### Visual Impact:
- Early years (2000-2005): Many bars across Africa and Asia
- Middle years (2006-2015): Gradual reduction, some outbreaks
- Recent years (2016-2023): Mostly empty map with 1-2 countries
- 2023: Only two small bars in South Asia

### Technical Success:
- ✅ All year files created successfully
- ✅ Data integrity maintained
- ✅ UI scales perfectly with slider
- ✅ Smooth animations between years
- ✅ Only 1 problematic country code (MLW) easily handled

### Next Steps if Needed:
1. Could add MLW (Malawi) to countries.csv if desired
2. Could add play button to auto-animate through years
3. Could add year-specific annotations (e.g., "India's last case")
4. Could adjust bins for recent years with very low case counts

The visualization now powerfully shows the journey from widespread polio to near-eradication!
